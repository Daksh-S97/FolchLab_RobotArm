# Applying the Dobot MG400 for manipulating cancer cuboids

This project aims to employ the Dobot MG400 desktop robot arm for biolaboratory use. Python is being used to interface with the robot via TCP/IP.

The software includes modules for detecting cuboids using OpenCV, discerning isolated samples, and movement control.
